		<h3>...Building the next generation of musicians and music lovers</h3>
		<p>Each year, the Junior Youth and Honors Orchestras provide approximately 100 students an opportunity to supplement their school and private music studies with high-caliber ensemble playing experience under the direction of professional conductor Maestro Farkhad Khudyev. This experience helps them develop knowledge of symphonic literature, as well as technical and artistic skill. The orchestras draw many of the best young musicians from throughout Monterey County - from Salinas and Monterey to Carmel Valley and Pacific Grove. <a href="../events/events.html" title="Upcoming Events">Click here</a> for a upcoming performance schedule of events.
